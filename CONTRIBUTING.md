### **Feature Requests**

If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement, feel free to open an issue labeled as "Feature Request." Provide details about:
- The problem you're trying to solve.
- How the feature would work.
- Any potential implementation ideas.

Example:

```plaintext
**Title**: Add support for multiple email templates

**Description**: 
It would be great if the package supported multiple email templates (e.g., welcome emails, confirmation emails, etc.) instead of just one. This would allow users to customize their emails further.

Potential implementation:
- Add a `templateType` parameter to the `sendConfirmation` method.
- Use different HTML files based on the `templateType`.
```
